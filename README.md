**Overview**

The Infinity Whisky Bottle is a mobile application designed for whisky enthusiasts who maintain a physical "infinity bottle"â€”a blend of various whiskies combined over time. This application serves as the digital brain for your bottle, providing a seamless way to log, track, and manage the ever-evolving composition of your unique blend. It helps you keep a perfect record of every pour and every addition, ensuring you always know exactly what's in your bottle.

**Key Features**
Virtual Bottle Management: Add a new whisky to your virtual bottle, specifying the brand, type, and volume. The app will automatically calculate the new total volume and composition.

Dynamic Mix Composition: View the current blend composition in real time. The app presents a clear breakdown of each whisky in the bottle, including its percentage contribution to the total volume.

Consumption Logging: When you pour a dram from your physical bottle, simply log the amount consumed in the app. The app will accurately update the virtual bottle's volume, ensuring it always mirrors your real-world collection.

Save & Share: Save snapshots of your bottle's recipe at different points in time. Share your blend's unique composition with friends, fellow enthusiasts, or on social media directly from the app.

**Support & Future Plans**

This project is supported by a passion for whisky and a commitment to creating a great tool for the community. We're excited about the future and have big plans to expand the project's scope:

iOS Application: The primary goal after the Android app's initial release is to develop a native iOS version, bringing the Infinity Bottle Tracker to a wider audience.

Play store and App store: get the app and updates directly from official stores

Physical Bottle Design: We envision a future where the app has a perfect physical counterpart. Our long-term objective is to design and produce a truly purpose-built infinity bottle that is as functional as it is beautiful, with unique features tailored to this concept.
